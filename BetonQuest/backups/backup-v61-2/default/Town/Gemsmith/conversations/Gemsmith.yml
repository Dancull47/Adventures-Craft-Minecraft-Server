    text: Gemstones are items which can be added onto certain Gear, providing increased stats! Some Gemstones can be obtained from Quests and Bosses, but most are commonly crafted by me. Crafting a Gemstone requires a Gem Base, the base changes depending on the Gemstone rarity. Gemstone Bases are crafted with common minerals found inside the Mines!
